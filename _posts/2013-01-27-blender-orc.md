This is the third post on my exploration of the open source 3D modeling software, [Blender]. I'm currently focusing my efforts on learning how to sculpt, what tools are available in that arena, and how I can best use them. Practice makes perfect. Or at least, less useless. As with my previous models to date, I'm not using any images or reference material when creating these characters, just sort of going where it leads. So without further ado, here's Orc.

![Orc-1](http://moonlitscript.com/attachments/blender/orc-1.png)

This time I started with a basic skull shape that I saved off when creating [Demon] from the last post. Using the clay brush with max curve to add thick layers to be smoothed and creased later. This is going to be an orc.

Heavy brows, bigger ears, very thick cheek bones, and a huge jaw line. Also added an underbite with some protruding fangs.

Giving him horns using the layer brush ( couldn't resist ), and earrings and a nose ring using a torus mesh which I scaled, rotated, duplicated, and moved into position.

Better view of Orc's massive jaw line. All the better to eat you with.

3/4 view of Orc. This is my favorite view. I like the exaggerated lines from the nostrils to the lips, and the age marks around the eyes. He feels very organic and real to me.

I turned off symmetry and clipped one of his horns as if he lost it in some long ago battle. This is also a good view of the intentional, but curious formation of his nose and the distinct creases that form it.

Here's a front view of Orc. You can see the thickness of the ears and lobes, the horizontal folds between the brows, the age marks around the eyes, the semi-recessed nostrils, and the creases above the chin. I know there are many more details that make a head feel real and organic, but I think I'm on the right track. While nowhere near climbing out of neophyte status, this is definitely my best work to date. Thanks for following along!
