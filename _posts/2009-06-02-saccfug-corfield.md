On Tuesday, June 9th, [Sean Corfield] will be presenting at the [Sacramento Area ColdFusion Users Group] here in Roseville. His topic of choice will be [Railo], a fairly robust competitor to Adobe's ColdFusion. As most probably know, Sean is an established leader in the ColdFusion community and has recently joined the Railo team as CTO, so this should prove to be an interesting occasion on both fronts. Check out [saccfug.com] for more details and location.
